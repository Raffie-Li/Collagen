Computer Vision Scripts for Automated Histological Quantification (Updated 1/12/24)
Developed for Thomas Weimbs Lab at UC Santa Barbara. See https://labs.mcdb.ucsb.edu/weimbs/thomas/ for more.

>= Python 3.10
>= OpenCV 4.6.0
>= Numpy 1.23.1

cystic_volume.py - Counts white pixels within the largest contour in a single image
collagen.py - Detection of collagen in Sirius Red/Fast Green tissue stains. Multi image
AWB_collagen.py - Auto white balance collagen. A more robust collagen detector which applies the white balance algorithm
                  from whitebalance.py. Important because white (cystic) pixels are not counted in the %area calculation,
                  so they must be accurately excluded so as not to throw off our results.
sma.py - Smooth muscle actin detector, for use with IFs. Multi image
whitebalance.py - samples the brightest pixels of an image and averages them to calculate a white balance correction
                  ratio for each color channel. Applies these ratios to obtain a neutral white balance image.

If you have never used Python before:
1. Install Standard Python Distro. This comes with pip, a package installer
    for Python, and IDLE, a general-use IDE for running the code --> https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Pip install OpenCV. There are many guides on the internet on how to do this.
   For a global install:
   ON WINDOWS:
      1. Launch Command Prompt
      2. Type "python -m pip install -U opencv-python"
      3. It should automatically install OpenCV and Numpy, which OpenCV is built on.
3. On Github, download the file you want to use. 
4. Create a folder somewhere to hold your photos.
5. Run IDLE. Click on "File" -> "Open" -> navigate to
    code file and open it.
6. Edit the path variable in the code to the location of your folder. Save.
    If the detector is single image, the path must contain the name of the image itself.
    ex: C:/Users/user/desktop/folder/image_name.jpg
7. Run the program. IDLE will request that you save your edits before it runs. Click OK.
8. The various scripts will differ from here. They may request your input to see/save the results. If images pop up,
    click any key to page through each photograph. See if you agree with the results before saving.
