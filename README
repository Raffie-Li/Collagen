Raffie's Feature Detectors (Updated 5/08/23)
Various Simple Scripts for Image Quantification
Part of my undergrad work at UC Santa Barbara. See https://labs.mcdb.ucsb.edu/weimbs/thomas/ for more.

Python 3.10
OpenCV 4.6.0
Numpy 1.23.1

main.py - General use HSV color detector, single image
whitespace.py - White pixel detector
collagen.py - Detection of collagen in Sirius Red/Fast Green tissue stains
sma.py - Smooth muscle actin detector, for use with IFs

Instructions for Running in IDLE (assuming you know nothing):
1. Install Standard Python Distro (Comes with IDLE and Pip)
2. Pip install OpenCV & Numpy. Can be done globally or in venv
    if you prefer a different IDE.
3. On Github, click on collagen.py, then "Raw", then right click
    and "Save as" to your hard drive.
4. Create a folder somewhere to hold your photos.
5. Run IDLE. Click on "File" -> "Open" -> navigate to
    collagen.py and open it.
6. Edit the path in line 13 to the location of your folder. Save.
7. Run the program. It will spit out percentages in the console.
8. It will then ask if you would like to see the results.
    Input 'y' and it will overlay the collagen lines onto the images.
    Click any key to page through each photograph. See if you agree with
    the results.
