Raffie's Color Based Feature Detector (Updated 2/25/23)

Python 3.10
OpenCV 4.6.0
Numpy 1.23.1

main.py can detect any HSV color for a single image. It can be easily adapted for other stains.
collagen.py detects colors for an entire folder.
This readme was written for NICK, who is only interested in collagen.py.

Instructions for Running in IDLE (assuming you know nothing):
1. Install Standard Python Distro (Comes with IDLE and Pip)
2. Pip install OpenCV & Numpy. Can be done globally or in venv
    if you prefer a different IDE.
3. On Github, click on collagen.py, then "Raw", then right click
    and "Save as" to your hard drive.
4. Create a folder somewhere to hold your photos.
5. Run IDLE. Click on "File" -> "Open" -> navigate to
    collagen.py and open it.
6. Edit the path in line 13 to the location of your folder. Save.
7. Run the program. It will spit out percentages in the console.
8. It will then ask if you would like to see the results.
    Input 'y' and it will overlay the collagen lines onto the images.
    Click any key to page through each photograph. See if you agree with
    the results.

It does everything you asked for. The only things I can think of would be saving the images for use
as figures, or spitting out percentages as .csv for import to Excel. Let me know if that's helpful.
