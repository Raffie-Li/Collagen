Raffie's Feature Detectors (Updated 5/31/23)
Various Simple Scripts for Image Quantification
Part of my undergrad work at UC Santa Barbara. See https://labs.mcdb.ucsb.edu/weimbs/thomas/ for more.

Python 3.10
OpenCV 4.6.0
Numpy 1.23.1

main.py - General use HSV color detector, single image
whitespace.py - White pixel detector, multi image
whitespace2.py - Detects whitespace within the largest contour, single image
collagen.py - Detection of collagen in Sirius Red/Fast Green tissue stains, multi image
sma.py - Smooth muscle actin detector, for use with IFs, multi image

Instructions:
1. Install Standard Python Distro. This comes with pip, a package installer
    for Python, and IDLE, a general-use IDE for running the code.
2. Pip install OpenCV & Numpy. Google how to do this. 
    Can be done globally or in venv if you want to use a different IDE.
3. On Github, download the file you want to use. 
4. Create a folder somewhere to hold your photos.
5. Run IDLE. Click on "File" -> "Open" -> navigate to
    code file and open it.
6. Edit the path variable in the code to the location of your folder. Save.
    If the detector is single image, the path must contain the name of the image itself.
    ex: C:/Users/user/desktop/folder/image_name.jpg
7. Run the program. It will spit out percentages in the console.
8. It will then ask if you would like to see the results.
    Input 'y' and it will overlay the collagen lines onto the images.
    Click any key to page through each photograph. See if you agree with
    the results.
