Raffie's Color Based Feature Detector (WIP)

Python 3.10
Requires OpenCV and Numpy
-Nick, if you've used Tim's SMA then you shouldn't need to pip anything else.

Instructions:
1. You can run it in IDLE if you don't have a preferred IDE.
2. Change the filepath in line 14 to wherever your desired photograph is located.
3. Lines 17-18 define the color threshold. 
	-Each array of three numbers represents hue, saturation, and value in that order.
	-If you wish to detect other colors:
		-OpenCV takes H values between 0-179 and S,V values between 0-255
		-Use HSVgradient.png to find the proper hues. You can have a very wide range
		depending on the stain.
		-S represents color purity while V represents color lightness. These likely
		won't need to be adjusted unless you are detecting black or white.
4. Run it. Collagen percentages will display in the console.
5. If you wish to save one of the images, use cv.imwrite('filename.extension', variable)
